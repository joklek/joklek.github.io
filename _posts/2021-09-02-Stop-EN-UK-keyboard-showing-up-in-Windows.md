This is a quick blogpost to explain and guide you on how to solve a problem in Windows that I've been living with for a few years already, and it is driving me mad, as a bilingual user and I am VERY happy to find and share the solution with you. Let's go.

## Step 1a)
First, in your Settings app, or in start menu go to "Region Settings". There, click on "Additional date, time & regional settings" at the bottom or left side of the window.

![In settings or in start menu find "Region Settings"](/assets/settings_app.png)

## Step 1b)
Alternatively, you can use Control Panel. In it, select "Clock and Region".

![Select "Clock and Region"](/assets/control_panel.png)

## Step 2)
Select "Region"

![Select "Region"](/assets/control_panel_2.png)

## Step 3)
Select the "Administrative" tab and then select "Change system locale...". This will require admin rights.

![Select the "Administrative" tab and then select "Change system locale..."](/assets/region_settings.png)

## Step 4)
Select your main locale (probably `English (United States)`)

![Select your main locale (probably English (United States))](/assets/region_settings_2.png)

## Step 5)
Select "OK" and then and then select "Restart Now"

Your computer will now restart and the problem should be fixed once and for all!
